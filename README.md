# Working 💡
• Our project, SMIT's Nest🎓 is built entirely on React.js and supports Pre-Rendering with Static-Site-Generation which has been implemented using Next.js. The modern UI has been designed with the help of Tailwind CSS. 

• Most of our work will is established using GraphCMS and GraphQL respectively. GraphQL is a query language using which we can create schemas, models and retrieve data by firing graphql queries. GraphCMS on the other hand, is a Content Management System (CMS) using which the users can post content on the site. All the posts, comments are moderated based upon administrator permission.

# Fullstack chatting application  with User Authentication using Chat Engine

This is a chatting application built using Reactjs. @ant-design, axios and react-chat-engine were some of the dependencies that were used. User can create multiple chat rooms, get sound notification, send text, images, emojis, add users, change admin and a lot more. The backend has been made using [chat engine](https://chatengine.io/) which provides user and admin privileges <br><br>
